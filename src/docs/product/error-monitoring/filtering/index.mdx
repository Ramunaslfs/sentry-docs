Sentry provides several methods to filter data in your project. Using sentry.io to filter events is a simple method since you don't have to [configure and deploy your SDK to filter projects](/platforms/javascript/configuration/filtering).

### Inbound Data Filters

Inbound data filters allow you to determine which errors, if any, Sentry should ignore. Explore these by navigating to **[Project] » Project Settings » Inbound Filters.**

Inbound filters include:

- Common browser extension errors
- Events coming from localhost
- Known legacy browsers errors
- Known web crawlers
- By their error message
- From specific release versions of your code
- From certain IP addresses

Once applied, you can track the filtered events (numbers and cause) using the graph provided at the top of the Inbound Data Filters view.

### Rate Limit

Rate limits allow you to set the maximum volume of events a project will accept during a period of time. This type of limit can be useful for managing your monthly error event quota, but once a defined threshold is crossed, **subsequent error events will be dropped**. You shouldn't constantly hit your rate limit. Instead, regard it as a ceiling intended to protect you from unexpected spikes.

Under *[Project Settings] » Client Keys (DSN)*, then press the *Configure* buttton. Here, you can create multiple DSNs per project and assign different (or no) limits to each. This will allow you to dynamically allocate a DSN (with varying thresholds) depending on Release, Environment, and so forth.

For example, you may have a project in production that generates many alerts. A rate limit allows you to set the maximum amount of data to 500 events per minute, for instance. Additionally, you can create a second DSN for the same project for your staging environment, which is unlimited, ensuring your QA process is still untouched.
